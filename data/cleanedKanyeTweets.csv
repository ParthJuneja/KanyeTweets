55,jamie then said he’s actually got the  percent on both those dealswe as the creators and talent get so caught up in our vanity that we don’t read or understand the fine printlike dave chapelle said we need to stop giving up control over our own names and our likeness
56,shaq is in business with jamie salterjaimie first said he’s  with david beckham and  with shaqi said “jamie    there’s no such thing as  in business    who has the extra  percent for the control and voting rights”

267,there are  main pillars in a professional musicians business recording publishing touring merchandise  name and likeness
268,there are  main pillars in a professional musicians business publishingrecording touring merchandise name and likeness
269,this is a call for all artist to unify  i will get my masters  i got the most powerful lawyer in music and i can afford them but every artist must be freed and treated fairly
270,portalsare not just for royalties they are for your entire business  every audio file every asset every deal stored with the money money and music must stay together when your term ends download it all leav
271,it sounds basic and logical but t does not exist they focus on top earners and zero look at the  stores… only the top few artists are global that’s why their contract territory says globalroyalty department in every label no more separating finance teams from the music
272,royaltiesagain back to dependents you need a business manager to read how you did so you pay to see your money no moreroyalty portals need to show and do not nowevery song you deliveredevery store you are inhow many streams per songincome per son
273,advances are just loanson artists resigning these stop advances are loans with  interest rates or worse no other business in the world takes a look at the business buys shares starts to profit when it profits record companies have to buy into you not loan you
274,umg now has a  billion share holding stake in spotify this is the artists the system as to how we get share balances on our royalty statement needs to be created and a system on when artists can cash in
275,no more blanket licenses it should be clear from day one… what shares you get now and when you leave if your song helps a deal over the line you invested in that store  app same as they did
276,equity  blanket licenses are the majority of future new incomeif you’re with a major you have invested your ‘songs’ as shares in their power to get equity and deals almost all new deals now are based on all songs going to a store or app the equity is the artists
277,lawyersthe first thing that changes about record deals is actually lawyerswe need plain english contracts a lawyers role is to improve deals… not charge for contracts we cannot understand or track rewrite deals to be understandable from first read
278,dependantsartists must be dependent on no one but themselves to manage their catalog you should need no one else to understand the business you’re in
279,the record label  publisher is a service provider that receives a share of the income for a limited term the split can be  in the artists fav
280,the artist owns the copyright in the recordings and songs and leases them to the record label  publisher for a limited term  year deals
281,new recording and publishing deal guidelines

354,the media tries to kill our heroes one at a tim
355,we used to diss michael jackson the media made us call him crazy  then they killed him
356,people say it’s enough and i got my point across  the point isn’t across until we cross the poin
357,we sat back and watched nick cannon get canceled and we go to play ball in a bubble with black lives matter on our backs  brothers let’s stand together for real  there is no nba or music industry without black people  fair contracts matter  ownership matters
358,michael jackson bill cosby aaaaand wait for it  r kelly had documentaries made or were taken down by white media  there has never been a black media company that would take down a white celebrity
359,i know a lot of musicians are not allowed to say anything but i can’t be muted or cancelled so i’m going to say everything as always
360,i am the only person who can speak on this because i made multi billions outside of music no musicians make billions inside of music i’m going to change this
